== Factorio

'''

Factorio is awesome and runs by default on port: 34197 on UDP, allow connection through firewall. Something else

=== Download

Server versions can be downloaded from https://www.factorio.com/download-headless/stable[Factorio's download page].

The download request is redirected so to remedy this use the -O flag and the file name, example:

[source]
----
cd download

wget -O factorio_headless.tar.gz https://www.factorio.com/get-download/0.15.37/headless/linux64
----

=== Installation

Extract the server in the `/opt` directory:

[source]
----
sudo tar -xzf factorio_headless.tar.gz -C /opt
----

Verify that the `factorio` folder was created in the `/opt` directory:

[source]
----
cd /opt

ls -al
----

Create the `saves` directory:

[source]
----
cd /opt/factorio

mkdir saves
----

The server requires a save to be available to start. You can automatically generate one using the command:

[source]
----
/opt/factorio/bin/x64/factorio --create /opt/factorio/saves/{save-name}.zip
----

Or if you want to tweak the world generation for the map you can start Factorio on your PC, create a new game with the generation settings you want, save the game, and copy the save file to the Factorio server's save directory.

=== Setting up a user

For security reasons you should run the server as a separate user without root privelieges:

[source]
----
sudo adduser --disable-login --no-create-home --gecos factorio factorio
----

To run the server without being a root-user the factorio user needs to be set as owner:

[source]
----
sudo chown -R factorio:factorio /opt/factorio
----

=== Configuration

For the server to start you need to create the server-settings.json file. The Factorio provide you with an example by default that you can configure to meet your own needs:

[source]
----
cd /opt/factorio/data

sudo cp server-settings.example.json server-settings.json
----

A reference guide for the configuration can be found at https://wiki.factorio.com/Multiplayer#How_to_List_Your_Server-Hosted_Game_on_the_Matching_Server[the Factorio Wiki].

=== Setting up the service

If you want the Factorio server to start automatically on startup, you need to set up a service.

Lets start by creating the file and opening it for editing:

[source]
----
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/factorio.service
----

The file you created should contain:

[source]
----
[Unit]
Description = Factorio server

[Service]
Type = simple
User = factorio
ExecStart = /otp/factorio/bin/x64/factorio --start-server /opt/factorio/saves/{save_name}.zip --server-settings /opt/factorio/data/server-settings.json
----



== Things to consider

'''

Enable firewall? : If running in Azure this step is not nessecary

.Uncomplicated firewall
[source]
----
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw {allow|deny|disabled} {port:range}/{tcp|udp}
----
